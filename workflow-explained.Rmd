# Feather River EDI upload workflow 

The data format acknowledges the constraints and realities of field data collection and the data management unique to Feather River, while also ensuring data are interoperable across other datasets used in the Feather River surveys.

Establishing an agreed upon data format is an important component of providing timely and automated access to data for Feather River 

This repository cleans Fether River monitoring data:

## Data pull and checks

Ad-hoc analysis and QC

### highlights

  - [**combine_and_clean_data.R**](https://github.com/FlowWest/edi-feather-snorkel/tree/main/data-raw/data-prep-scripts/combine_and_clean_data.R) data analysis and QC. Combines earlier data, joins look up tables, creates "processed tables" (csv) 
    - cleans `unit` to be consistent
  -[**revised_snorkel_db_pull.R**](https://github.com/FlowWest/edi-feather-snorkel/tree/main/data-raw/data-prep-scripts/revised_snorkel_db_pull.R)
    - General cleaning of fields, for example: cleans species names, channel_geomorphic_unit, cleans instream_cover, etc

  - [**data pull/checks**](https://github.com/FlowWest/edi-feather-snorkel/tree/main/data-raw/data-prep-scripts) data analysis and QC. 
  
  - once data data tables are processed and combined as necessary, they are written onto the [**data folder**](data) to start uploading process
